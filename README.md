# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This app allows users to do two things. One, they can enter a number of calories and see how many reps/minutes of various exercises they would need to do to burn those calories. Also, they can enter an exercise and number of reps/minutes and see how many calories doing the exercise will burn. From there, they can also see how many reps/minutes of other exercises will burn an equivalent amount of calories.
